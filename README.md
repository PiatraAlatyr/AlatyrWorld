This project creates a simple simulation of tens of thousands of animals on an island divided into square regions.
The animals eat grass, eat each other, reproduce, starve, and then migrate to unoccupied regions.
The ecosystem is unbalanced, and some species eventually become dominant, just as in real life if evolution doesn't occur.
The application runs in the console by running the main MyApp class.
